class process:
    """
    A class defined for running all types of algorithms. It defines all the attributes required by a process.
    
    Attributes:
        process_name (str): The process name or number (e.g. P1, P2, etc)
        arrival_time (int): The arrival time of the process.
        burst_time (int): The burst time of the process.
        priority (int): The priority of the process.
    
    Methods:
    
    Output Requirements:
    
    - Execution Sequence
    - Turn Around Time (for each process)
    --- Formula: Turnaround Time (TAT)=Completion Time−Arrival Time (AT)
    
    - Finish Time (for each process)
    ---  Formula: Finish Time (FT)=Arrival Time (AT)+Turnaround Time (TAT)
    
    - Waiting Time (for each process)
    --- Formula: Waiting Time (WT)=Turnaround Time (TAT)−Burst Time
    
    - Average Turn Around Time
    --- Formula: Average Turnaround Time (AvgTAT)= 
                                                    Number of Processes/
                                            Sum of Turnaround Times of all processes
